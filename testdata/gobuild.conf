# If set, the (hypothetical) version (and beyond) of the Go toolchain that is not
# allowed for builds. Gobuild automatically downloads new SDKs. However, new Go
# toolchain versions may change behaviour which may cause binaries to no longer
# become reproducible with the flags gobuild uses to build. By refusing new
# versions, you have time to separately verify binaries with newer Go toolchains
# are still reproducible. Example: a version of go1.20 allows go1.18, go1.19,
# go1.19.1, but not go1.20, go1.21 or go2.0. Versions like go1.20rc1 are
# interpreted as go1.20, without rc1. (optional)
